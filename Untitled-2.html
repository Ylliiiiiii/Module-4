    1. Start with a new HTML file and set up the basic structure. 
2. Create a `<header>` element and include a heading that says "My Photo Gallery." 
3. Inside the header, add a navigation menu with two links: "Home" and "Gallery." 
4. Create a `<main>` element and divide it into two sections. 
5. In the first section, use the `<picture>` tag to display an image. Provide multiple sources with different resolutions for better responsiveness. 
6. In the second section, create a list of bookmarks related to your favourite topics. Each bookmark should link to a specific section within the same webpage.

            <p id="nature">Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
